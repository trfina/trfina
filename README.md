I am an IT professional that is currently building and fine-tuning my skills for full-stack web development or Dev/Ops.   I successfully completed the Ohio State University College of Engineering Coding Boot Camp in April 2022.   My previous IT work experience includes network administration, developing and teaching a computer science curriculum for a secondary school, and mainframe programming. 

-  Which now leads me to my next adventure: seeking and landing opportunities and assignments as a Full-Stack Web Developer or Dev/Ops!
