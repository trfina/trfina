I am a career Programmer/Analyst and Teacher with a gap in employment that has recently retooled my skills for opportuinities in programming and full-stack development.  

Successfully completed the Ohio State University College of Engineering Coding Boot Camp in April 2022 which helped me realize that I want to combine backend-stack technologies with previous networking experience.   

Previous IT work includes network administration, developing and teaching a computer science curriculum for a secondary school, and mainframe programming including COBOL.
