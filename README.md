I recently joined Accenture in January 2023 through the Midwest Returnship Program and am thrilled to be part of a cloud migration team as an analyst on the discovery and development team in the insurance sector. I want to continue to build my skills in cloud native architectures and technologies with a special interest in mainframe migration.  

Successfully completed the Ohio State University College of Engineering Coding Boot Camp in April 2022 which helped me realize that I am now pursuing my interest in clout native services and technologies. 

Previous IT work includes network administration, developing and teaching a computer science curriculum for a secondary school, and mainframe programming including COBOL.
