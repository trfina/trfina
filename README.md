I am currently as cloud migration analyst in the insurance sector. I want to continue to build my skills in cloud native architectures and technologies with a special interest in mainframe migration.  
Successfully completed the Ohio State University College of Engineering Coding Boot Camp in April 2022 which helped me realize that I am now pursuing my interest in cloud native services and technologies. 

Previous IT work includes network administration, developing and teaching a computer science curriculum for a secondary school, and mainframe programming including COBOL.
